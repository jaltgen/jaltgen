- 👋 Hi, so you've found my weird github space. Welcome.
- 👀 I’m interested in media workflows, cloud, life-long learning and how to leverage technology to make all our lives better.
- 🌱 working on my AWS SAA, as well as becoming familiar with the stuff I've missed in the DevOps / Agile domain
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on creating cool Obsidian workflows.
- 📫 How to reach me: mostly just here, for now, of in the Obsidian Forum or Discord.
