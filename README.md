- 👋 Hi, so you've found my weird github space. Welcome.
- 👀 I’m interested in systems design and architecture, cloud, life-long learning and how to leverage technology to make all our lives better.
- 🌱 since getting AWS certified, I'm growing my Terraform / Ansible muscle and develop a love/hate relationship with bash
- 💞️ playing with my homelab, improving my workspace, selfhosting, my notes system - all those take my time when I'm not walking my dog
- 📫 How to reach me: mostly just here, for now
